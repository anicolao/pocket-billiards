# Vision Document: Pocket Billiards

## Project Vision

To create an exceptional, touchscreen-native pocket billiards game that brings the classic experience of pool to large-format digital displays, making the game accessible and enjoyable in community spaces, entertainment venues, and modern game rooms.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to develop a high-quality, open-source billiards game that:
- Delivers realistic physics and authentic gameplay
- Provides an intuitive, natural touch interface
- Scales beautifully to large displays
- Remains accessible to players of all skill levels
- Serves as a showcase for modern web gaming capabilities

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Public Spaces**: Museums, libraries, community centers with interactive displays
- **Entertainment Venues**: Bars, restaurants, arcades with touchscreen tables
- **Home Users**: Enthusiasts with large touchscreen devices or interactive coffee tables
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities with interactive learning spaces

### User Personas

**"The Casual Player"**
- Wants to play a quick game during a break
- Expects intuitive controls without a learning curve
- Enjoys the social aspect of multiplayer gaming
- Values visual polish and smooth gameplay

**"The Pool Enthusiast"**
- Appreciates realistic physics and game mechanics
- Knows traditional billiards rules and expects them to be followed
- Enjoys competitive play and skill development
- Values accuracy in ball behavior and shot mechanics

**"The Venue Operator"**
- Needs reliable, low-maintenance software
- Wants engaging content for their interactive displays
- Requires easy setup and configuration
- Values professional appearance and user engagement

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Touch-First Philosophy
Everything in the game is designed for touch interaction first, with mouse/keyboard as secondary input methods. Tap-based controls feel natural and responsive on large touchscreens.

### 2. Immediate Playability
Players should be able to walk up to the display and start playing within seconds, without tutorials or complex setup. The game provides gentle guidance through visual cues rather than text-heavy instructions.

### 3. Realistic but Accessible
While physics should be accurate and satisfying, the game shouldn't punish casual players. Difficulty settings and optional assists help bridge the gap between arcade fun and simulation realism.

### 4. Visual Excellence
As a showcase piece for large displays, the game must look stunning with smooth, high-framerate animations, clear readable graphics at any scale, and a professional polished aesthetic.

### 5. Performance First
The game must run smoothly on a wide range of hardware, from high-end gaming PCs to embedded display systems. Optimization is fundamental to the user experience.

## Technology Approach

The game is built as an HTML5 Canvas-based application for maximum compatibility and ease of deployment. See [INITIAL_DESIGN.md](INITIAL_DESIGN.md) for technical implementation details.

## Success Criteria

The project will be successful when:
- New users can start playing within 30 seconds
- The game runs smoothly (60 FPS) on mid-range hardware
- Physics feel realistic and satisfying
- Touch controls are intuitive and responsive
- The game is deployed in public installations

## Competitive Landscape

### Differentiation
Unlike existing digital billiards games, Pocket Billiards:
- Is specifically designed for large touchscreens, not mobile phones
- Is fully open-source and free to use/modify
- Runs in any modern web browser without installation
- Focuses on public/shared gaming experiences
- Prioritizes accessibility and immediate playability

### Inspiration
We draw inspiration from:
- Classic arcade pool games for their immediate fun
- Professional billiards simulators for their physics accuracy
- Modern web games for their accessibility and polish
- Interactive museum exhibits for their intuitive design

## Open Source Commitment

This project is and will remain open source under the GNU General Public License v3.0, ensuring:
- Free access for all users
- Community-driven development
- Transparency in implementation
- Educational value for developers

## Conclusion

Pocket Billiards aims to be more than just another digital pool game—it's a vision for how classic games can be reimagined for modern interactive displays. By focusing on exceptional touch interfaces, realistic physics, and accessible gameplay, we're creating an experience that serves casual players, enthusiasts, and venue operators alike.
